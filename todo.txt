    remove white area from aroun cards (check Luke smith video)
    don't hover top card if max card already drawn
    center drawn cards
    shadow effect on hovered card
    prevent cards from shrinking to fit screen; have them be static sized based on scren width
    idea: instead of rendering div onClick, have the card divs already spaced out and insert a card
    prompt "click the deck to draw a card."

    apply card border style (white border with rounded edges)
    check that all cards are the same height and width
